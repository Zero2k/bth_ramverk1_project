            <p>This website is part of the last assignment in the course ramverk1 at BTH and it's created by Viktor Bengtsson who's currently studying web development at BTH (Blekinge Institute of Technology).</p>

            <p>The site is built with PHP and a lightweight PHP framework called <a href="https://github.com/mosbth/anax">Anax</a> and a couple of modules. The Anax framework is perfect when you want to build small websites such as blog, personal site or a forum like this.</p>

            <p>Coin Overflow is a clone of the popular website Stack Overflow where developers can discuss software development and programming. However, on Coin Overflow it's all about cryptocurrency trading and investing.</p>

            <p>Just like Stack Overflow, users can post questions and then vote on the questions they like the most and by doing so they will earn points which is displayed as Karma on their profile pages.</p>

            <p><b>Currenty, the following actions will earn you Karma:</b></p>
